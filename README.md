## Sentiment classification
This simple code file takes various mails, reviews, ratings, etc to classify the sentiment of that review/comment (positive, negative, neutral, etc) using the BERT model. The data was sourced from the following site: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/columbine/imdb-dataset-sentiment-analysis-in-csv-format?resource=download.

Our performance evaluation demonstrates a poor performance on both validation and test sets. This could be down to the parameters or the scale of the data. This is something to review for future fixes.

Training can be quite computationally heavy, so make sure that your PC can handle it.
